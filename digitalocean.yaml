; This website is hosted as a static website on the Digital Ocean app platform.
; When changes are pushed to github, Digital Ocean will pull those changes, run
; hugo to generate the static website, and deploy that website. This file 
; controls the Digital Ocean app. It tells Digital Ocean where to pull the code
; from and how to build the website.

; Although we store it in git, Digital Ocean does not read it from the git
; repository when it pulls the code. This is because an application can contain
; many components from many git repositories. Instead, make changes to this file
; and then push those changes manually with
;
;   $ make update-app
;
; or
;
;   $ doctl apps update dcd972c2-ff60-4fbc-bba2-6f97f778d11e --spec digitalocean.yaml
